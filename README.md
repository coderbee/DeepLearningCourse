Assignments and learnings from Coursera's Deep learning course

Notes:
The broad steps in implementing neural netwoks are as follows

1) Define Model Structure 
    - number of layers, # neurons per layer
    - activation functions to use
2) Initialize model parameters
3) Iterate through this
    - Calculate cost function J using forward propogation
    - Calculate the current gradients using backward propogation
    - Update weights
