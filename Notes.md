## Course2 Week1 
- Applied ML is highly iterative, hyperparameter choices aren't clear initially
- Training/Dev(hold-out crossvalidation)/Test sets 
- In Big Data era ( 1Million training samples etc) 98%/1%/1% split isn't uncommon
- Bias / Variance of the model
    - High Bias - Underfitting the data. 
      - Training set error is high(~15%), implying the model didnt fit the dataset properly
    - High Variance - Overfitting the data.
      - Training set error (~1%)  << Dev set error (~11%)
